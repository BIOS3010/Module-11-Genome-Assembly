# Module-11-Genome-Assembly

The purpose of this exercise is to assemble the genome of a SARS-CoV-2 virus. We will compare two different approaches to genome assembly, reference-based and _de novo_ assembly. We will use PacBio HiFi reads (circular consensus - CCS) generated with the [HiFiViral SARS-CoV-2 kit](https://www.pacb.com/research-focus/microbiology/public-health/covid-19-sequencing-tools-and-resources/). HiFi reads provide base-level resolution with >99.9% single-molecule read accuracy.

## Set up
* Click [here](00-Setup.md) to set up everything before you start on the exercises.

## Download and inspect PacBio HiFi reads  

* Go to [these exercises](01-Get_fastq_files.md), and follow the steps. 

## Reference-based assembly

* Go to [these exercises](02-Reference-assembly.md), and follow the steps.
