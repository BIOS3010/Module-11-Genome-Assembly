# Module-11-Genome-Assembly

The purpose of the exercises for week 1 of the "Genome Assembly" module is to assemble the genome of a SARS-CoV-2 virus. We will use the reference-based approach to genome assembly. We will use PacBio HiFi reads (circular consensus - CCS) generated with the [HiFiViral SARS-CoV-2 kit](https://www.pacb.com/research-focus/microbiology/public-health/covid-19-sequencing-tools-and-resources/). HiFi reads provide base-level resolution with >99.9% single-molecule read accuracy. Next week we will dive into some more details of _de novo_ assembly and we will learn how to perform quality assessment of our assembly.
